### Why did we create SaaS Boilerplate?

As a software house, we feel the struggle of building a product from scratch like nobody else. Moreover, we understand how tiresome the creation of the same basic features over and over again could be for developers. So why reinvent the registration or checkout process? Right, no reason!

### What is a SaaS Boilerplate?

It’s the developer’s way out of the vicious circle of redeveloping dull and repetitive features. To be more precise, it’s a dev’s starter kit that helps set up a new project in just 3 days using React and Django. Then, the scope of your project is just a matter of your imagination!

### How does it work?

Our SaaS Boilerplate is built on AWS infrastructure with CI/CD ready to set up and is possible to integrate with Stripe and Contentful. The list of its features includes:

- CRUD functions (create, read, update and delete),
- Authorization (including OAuth and email verification),
- Transactional emails (out-of-the-box creator, templates, and scheduling),
- Monthly subscriptions and one-time payments (free plan implementation included),
- CMS integration (Contentful),
- E2E testing of all features during deployment.
